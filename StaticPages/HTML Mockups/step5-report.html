    <h3 class="headingColor padding5 centerAlign">Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>298 residents of King, Pierce, and Snohomish county worked
      together online over the course of 5 weeks to learn about
      transportation problems in our region, discuss their own
      concerns, and create a package of transportation projects
      and funding sources to address our transportation needs.
      On November 2, 2007 they released the results of their
      efforts.</p>
    <p>The package contains 32 road and transit projects across
      the 3 county region. It is funded by a combination of bridge
      tolls, parking taxes, and vehicle excise fees. The total
      cost of the package is $16 billion. The package was endorsed
      by 81% of the participants (256 our of 298 participating).</p>

    <h4>Concerns expressed by participants</h4>
    <p>The first step of the Let’s Improve Transportation challenge
      was brainstorming concerns about the regional transportation
      system. The following summaries of concern themes were
      synthesized by the moderator using a computer-assisted
      process and then revised based on participant feedback.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <h4>Pedestrian Safety</h4>
      <p>Many participants were concerned about the safety of
        pedestrians on city streets. Several specific dangers
        and annoyances to pedestrians were identified, such as
        cars ignoring right turn on red restrictions, poor cross
        walk design, poor pedestrian facilities in construction
        areas, and cars parking on sidewalks. The behavior of "rouge" drivers
        was a particular item of concern as well as strategies
        for bringing them in line (better laws, better enforcement,
        and even encouraging pedestrians to hit the cars of offenders).
      <p>110 out of 134 agree that this summary reflects the
        concerns of all participants.<br />

    <h3 class="headingColor padding5 centerAlign">2. “Planning
      factors” used in project evaluation</h3>
    <p>The second step included a review, discussion, and weighting
      of “planning factors” used to evaluate the proposed transportation
      projects. These planning factors were adapted from ....
      They were used by a panel of transportation specialists
      to qualitatively “score” proposed projects. <a href="#appendixA">Appendix
      A</a> includes a detailed discussion of the scoring process.
      These scores, in turn, were used by participants in their
      effort to evaluate the benefits or drawbacks of the proposed
      transportation projects (see <a href="#projects">following
      section</a> for details).</p>
    <p>Participants were given the opportunity to weight the
      planning factors based on their individual preferences
      by distributing 100 total points among the 10 factors.
      The following table displays information about the planning
      factors and participant weight preferences.</p>

        Project selection and personal package creation</a></h3>
    <p>The third step began with a review and discussion of a
      list of 44 proposed transportation improvement projects.
      This was followed by a review and discussion of available
      funding options. Finally, participants were each given
      the opportunity to create their own personal transportation
      package including both a set of projects and a set of revenue
      sources which provide enough money to pay for the projects.
      We tabulated the results of participant project and funding
      source selection below. Note: only 212 of the total 298
      participants completed this step. The percentages below
      refer to the percent of participants who completed this

      Evaluation of packages</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Participants created 212 unique packages. In order to
      narrow down the field of packages under consideration the
      system automatically created five new packages that collectively
      represent the diversity of packages created by participants
      in Step 3 (this process is described in Appendix B). Participants
      reviewed these five packages as well as the “RTID” package
      that will appear on the ballot on November 8, 2007.</p>
    <p>Participants votes twice regarding their willingness to
      endorse each of the six different packages, first a poll
      after a preliminary discussion, and then a final vote after
      additional discussion in light of poll results...</p>
