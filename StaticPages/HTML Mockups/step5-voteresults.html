		<p>298 residents of King, Pierce, and Snohomish county worked together online over
			the course of 5 weeks to learn about transportation problems in our region, discuss
			their own concerns, and create a package of transportation projects and funding
			sources to address our transportation needs. On November 2, 2007 they released
			the results of their efforts.</p>
		<p>The package contains 32 road and transit projects across the 3 county region.
			It is funded by a combination of bridge tolls, parking taxes, and vehicle excise
			fees. The total cost of the package is $16 billion. The package was endorsed by
			81% of the participants (256 our of 298 participating).</p>
