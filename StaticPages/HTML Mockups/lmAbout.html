<p><i>[The following is a hypothetical description of how this website would be related to a real transportation decision making process.]</i></p>
<p>Regional transportation policy makers are planning to put
	a measure on the ballot in King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties.
	The measure will ask voters if they wish to raise taxes to pay
	for a package of regional transportation improvement projects.
	However the policy makers have yet to determine which of the
	proposed projects to include on the ballot, nor have they determined
	what kind of tax increases should be used to pay for these projects.
	To answer these questions, they have requested that a large
	advisory group of citizens work together to create and endorse
	a recommended transportation package for this ballot measure. <strong>You</strong> are
	invited to serve as a member of this advisory group.</p>

<p>While the policy makers do not promise to keep every detail
	of the package recommended by this citizen advisory group in
	the ballot measure, they do promise to strongly consider the
	citizens'  suggestions. Given that the ballot measure
	will need to have broad appeal to voters in order to pass, the
	policy makers are more likely to consider recommendation that
	are endorsed by a significant majority of the advisory group
	members.</p>
<p>Let's Improve Transportation is a website that has been
	developed to assist you and other advisory group members in
	your process of creating recommendations. There are five steps
	in this process.</p>
<h3><a name="step1" class="headerColor">Step 1: Discuss Concerns</a></h3>

    <p>Before we can determine how to best improve our transportation
    	system, we need to have some shared understanding of what
    	the problems are. Only with this understanding can we determine
    	which proposed transportation projects are most likely to
    	provide the kinds of improvements we seek.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1a: Brainstorm</strong>
        <ul>

          <li>All participants brainstorm and "tag" concerns about the  transportation system.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1b: Review Summaries </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The  moderator identifies themes among these concerns and writes a preliminary  summary  of each theme. (<a href="litfaq.jsp">Read more</a>)</li>

          <li> Participants  review and discuss the theme summaries, and suggest revisions.</li>

          <li>The moderator revises theme summaries to reflect participant suggestions, as appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="step2" class="headerColor">Step 2: Review Criteria</a></h3>

    <p>Transportation planners use "criteria" to evaluate which
    	proposed transportation projects are most likely to provide
    	the kinds of improvements we seek. In this step we review
    	and discuss nine criteria. In addition to reviewing how
    	planners use the nine criteria to score proposed transportation
    	projects, we discuss how well the nine criteria reflect
    	the range of participant concerns represented in the summaries
    	from Step 1.</p>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>2a: Review Criteria </strong>
        <ul>
          <li> Participants review and discuss criteria in order to evaluate  how adequately they reflect each concern theme.</li>
        </ul>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>2b: Weigh Criteria </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Participants individually choose their favorite criteria and weigh the  relative importance of these criteria for project evaluation.</li>
        </ul>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="step3" class="headerColor">Step 3: Create Packages</a></h3>

    <p>A  "transportation package" is simply a set of transportation
    	projects and sources of funding to pay for those projects.
    	In this step we review a list of proposed transportation
    	project which are scored based on the criteria discussed
    	in Step 2 and funding options available to pay for these
    	projects. Finally, we each individually create our own preferred
    	transportation package.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 3a: Review Projects</strong><br />
        <ul>

          <li>Participants review road and transit projects proposed as improvements  to the central Puget Sound regional transportation system.</li>

          <li>Participants discuss the project information and  criteria scores to evaluate the relative benefits and drawbacks.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 3b: Review Funding Options</strong><br />

        <ul>
          <li>Participants review a variety of taxes available to raise funds to pay  for regional transportation projects. They also learn about the likely  personal costs of these taxes, as well as the costs to other residents.</li>
          <li>Participants discuss the funding options to evaluate the relative benefits and drawbacks.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Step 3c: Create a Personal Transportation Package</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Participants create their own transportation package, selecting from a  menu of project and funding options. A help tool is available to  suggest items which may fit the participant's preferences.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="step4" class="headerColor">Step 4: Evaluate Packages</a></h3>

    <p>In order to simplify our decision process, we need to
    	narrow down the number of different packages considered.
    	To help, the website automatically creates five new packages
    	that collectively represent the diversity of packages created
    	by participants in Step 3. In Step 4 we evaluate the five
    	new packages and determine which one (or ones) we wish to
    	collectively endorse as our recommendation.</p>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>4a: Compare Packages </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Participants review information about each  package.</li>
          <li>Participants compare the overall criteria scores of each package, as well as costs and other package details.</li>

          <li>Participants discuss the relative benefits and drawbacks of the packages.</li>
          <li>The moderator periodically polls participants about their willingness  to endorse different packages in order to help them identify areas of  agreement and disagreement.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>4b: Final Vote </strong>
        <ul><li>At a designated time, participants are asked whether or not they are  willing to endorse the most popular package. If the majority of  participants say yes, the package is designated as the majority  endorsement.</li>

          <li>Dissenting voters have the opportunity to vote on a minority endorsement.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="step5" class="headerColor">Step 5: Prepare Group Report</a></h3>
    <p>The final step is to compose a report about the results of this  activity which will be delivered to transportation decision makers.</p>
    <ul><li>The moderator creates a  draft report and notifies participants.</li>

      <li> Participants  review and discuss this draft report and submit their comments and suggested  revisions.</li>
      <li> The  moderator makes revisions and includes participant comments when appropriate.</li>

      <li> Participants  review the final report.</li>
      <li>All participants vote on whether to approve or disapprove the report.  If a majority approves the report, then it is forwarded on to decision  makers along with the results of this final vote.</li>
    </ul>
