			<h3>Welcome SUVdriver. You qualify to participate in Let's Improve Transportation!</h3>
			<p>Congratulations! You are eligible to receive $50 if you participate in the
				entire Let’s Improve Transportation decision process (AKA the “LIT Challenge”).
				To receive payment you must complete two questionnaires and participate in each
				of 5 steps in the LIT Challenge. You can participate at your own convenience
				wherever you have access to the Internet. The LIT Challenge will take place over
				a 4 week period, starting October 1, 2007 and concluding October 29, 2007. We
				estimate that full participation will take about 8 hours of your time, spread
				out over the 4-week period. However you are encouraged to spend as much time
				on the LIT website as you like. Details about the requirements for payment can
				be found in the participant consent form at the bottom of this page. If you prefer,
				you can also choose to participate as an <a href="#">unpaid volunteer</a>, with
				no requirements for your participation.</p>
