	<p>In January 2009 the Oregon Coastal Management Program, part of Oregon's Department of Land Conservation and Development, released a document entitled 
	<i>Climate Ready Communities: A Strategy for Adapting to Impacts of Climate Change on the Oregon Coast</i>. This document includes a discussion of 
	"The Likely Effects of Climate Change on the Oregon Coast," which is excerpted below.  Read the full document on the OCMP website <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/ENERGY/GBLWRM/docs/climate_ready_communities.pdf"title="CLIMATE READY COMMUNITIES"target="blank">here</a>.</p>
	<h2 class="headerColor">"</h2>
	<p><b>Climate and the Oregon Coast</b></p>
	<p>The likely effects of climate change on the Oregon
coast may come as no surprise to Oregonians who are familiar
with winter storms and the variability of the climate
and ocean conditions on the Oregon coast. The El Niño
climate events of 1982-83 and 1997-98 gave Oregonians a
taste of higher sea level, stronger storms, warmer ocean
temperatures, and altered marine ecosystem.</p>
	<p>Oregon’s coastal communities have begun to experience
the effects of climate change in the form of higher wave
heights, more powerful winter storms, and major ocean
shoreline erosion. Other phenomena are expected due to
the Earth’s changing climate such as rising sea level and
tidal height, hypoxic nearshore ocean waters, seasonal temperature
changes, more acidic ocean waters, and changes in
forest cover.</p>
	<p>It is important that coastal communities understand the
potential effects of climate change in order to take action to
avoid risks, reduce damage and make choices that will
maximize community resilience. This paper outlines some
of the principal ways that the Oregon coast is likely to be
affected.</p>

	<p><b>Key Physical Changes in Oregon’s
Coastal Climate and Weather</b></p>
	<p>Changes in Earth’s climate, driven by atmospheric
warming caused by greenhouse gases, will affect the climate
and weather of the Oregon coast in a variety of ways, some
familiar, others dramatically new. Exactly how these
changes will affect any particular community or region of
the coast cannot now be accurately predicted. However,
scientific evidence strongly suggests that coastal climate and
weather are likely to change in four principal ways.</p>
	<p><i>Temperature</i><br>
	The current best estimate for future warming is about 0.5° F per
decade, at least in the next few decades. The Pacific Northwest is projected
to have greater warming during summer than in the winter.
The mean temperature may increase significantly beyond current
ranges over the course of the next century.</p>
	<p><i>Storms</i><br>
	Data show that both the frequency and intensity of storms have
increased in recent years, and individual storms are producing higher
waves and storm surges. Projected changes suggest that future winter
storms may be similar to recent strong El Niño-influenced storms
that accelerated coastal erosion. More frequent, longer and more intense
storms will cause greater damage.</p>
	<p><i>Sea level</i><br>
	Sea level is expected to rise significantly by 2100 but how much
cannot now be predicted for any given location. Average sea level
rose worldwide about 6.7 inches in the 20th century. A recent report
concluded that sea level could rise on the Washington coast by 22
inches by 2050 and by 50 inches by 2100. The most current projections
do not include the effects of rapid ice melt being experienced in
Greenland or Antarctica. Sea level rise will generate increased tidal
heights in estuaries and coastal rivers that are affected by tides.</p>
	<p><i>Precipitation</i><br>
	Precipitation in the Pacific Northwest is expected to increase but
to remain within historical ranges for rainfall. Winter precipitation is
projected to increase, while summers will be longer and even drier
than at present. For the Coast Range and lower elevations, precipitation will be mostly rain, as at present. Some research anticipates an
increase in intense precipitation events.</p>
	<p><b>Likely Effects on Oregon’s Coastal
Communities</b></p>
	<p>Climate shapes communities in many ways; some obvious,
others subtle. The economy and culture of coastal
communities, for instance, are tightly linked to climate. Historic
precipitation patterns and generally mild temperature
support the timber, agricultural, and recreational economic
sectors. The effects of climate changes can be generally described,
even though their magnitude, timing, and location
cannot be known for certain. Anticipating both gradual
change and episodic events is essential to enable communities
to become resilient to effects from climate change.</p>
	<p><b>Community Infrastructure</b><br>
	Climate conditions are generally factored into the design of
community infrastructure. As climate conditions change, some infrastructure
systems may be less effective or may fail altogether, which
could alter the function, value, or viability of improvements these
systems protect or serve.</p>
	<p><b><i>Transportation and navigation</i></b></p>
<p><i>Coastal roads, highways, and rail lines</i> are at risk from the effects
of increased winter precipitation, increased coastal erosion, and
flooding. Over the long term, roads, highways, and railroads will be
affected by sea level rise and increased tidal elevations along the
ocean shore, estuaries, and coastal rivers.</p>
<p><i>Airport runways</i> such as those in North Bend and Astoria are
located on filled estuarine wetlands and may be at risk of inundation
from storm surge and high tides and, over time by sea level and increased
tidal heights.</p>
<p><i>Port facilities, jetties and groins</i> will be subject to damage
from larger storm waves. Watershed flooding may increase sediment
loads into estuaries and thus increase the need for dredging of navigational
channels. Increased tidal height will affect docks and bulkheads.</p>
 
	<p><b><i>Shore Protection and Flood Control Structures</i></b></p>
<p><i>Dikes and levees:</i> Extensive areas in Oregon’s estuaries are protected
from tidal inundation by dikes and levees. Rising sea level and
the increased likelihood of inundation from higher storm surge and
tidal heights, especially in times of river flooding, may threaten the
integrity of dikes and levees. Infrastructure and development on lands
protected by dikes are at risk of damage and inundation as dikes fail.</p>
<p><i>Shore protection improvements:</i> Some portions of Oregon’s
ocean shorelines have been armored against erosion from ocean
waves, primarily in front of properties developed before 1977. As
shorelines erode landward in response to higher sea level and storms,
armored properties are at risk of becoming peninsulas, then islands,
and then overtopped. An increase in significant wave heights is likely
to damage or cause failure of some hardened shorelines, potentially
resulting in damage to nearby unprotected property and infrastructure.</p>
 
	<p><b><i>Municipal Services</i></b></p>
<p><i>Stormwater systems:</i> The capacity of local stormwater management
systems may be exceeded as the magnitude or frequency of
rainfall events increases, especially as tidal elevations rise leading to
localized flooding, accelerated deterioration, and possible system failure.
Systems at or near capacity today may be unable to handle future
storm loads, which could have a significant effect on location of future
development.</p>
<p><i>Water supply and wastewater treatment:</i> Rainfall in winter is
projected to increase. However, storing water across longer, drier
summers may be a problem for some coastal communities where
storage systems are already at or over capacity during summer. Reduced
precipitation in summer months, especially in conjunction with
warmer winter temperatures, may reduce the water available for municipal
supply systems. In addition, wastewater treatment facilities are
usually located at the lowest elevation in a watershed, which places
those facilities at risk from rising sea level and tidal elevation.</p>
<p><i>Recreational facilities:</i> Increased erosion along Oregon’s ocean
shore from rising sea levels and coastal storms may seriously alter
beaches, and in some cases, the infrastructure necessary for safe access
to and from beaches and coastal parks. Coastal forest trails and
campgrounds may experience frequent damage from high winds and
flooding.</p>
	<p><b>Coastal Natural Systems</b></p>
	<p>Many familiar coastal habitats, ecosystems, and natural resources
will be affected by climate change. Low-lying habitats and ecosystems
are especially vulnerable to floods, tides and ocean waves. Temperature
and precipitation changes will affect the distribution and composition
of forests, riparian areas, and other terrestrial habitats. Even
rocky intertidal habitats are vulnerable to increased atmospheric and
ocean temperatures.</p>
	<p><b><i>Rivers and Streams</i></b></p>
<p><i>Coastal rivers:</i> Streams that drain the Coast Range will carry increased
runoff from greater winter rainfall but will become drier in
summer due to decreased rainfall. More severe rainfall events in these
streams may increase the frequency and severity of flooding episodes.
Warmer summer temperatures and lower summer stream flows may
raise water temperatures to the detriment of salmon and other coldwater
species.</p>
<p><i>Inland rivers:</i> Snow melt runoff is a factor in four rivers that are
important to the Oregon coast and coastal fisheries: the Columbia,
Umpqua, Rogue, and Klamath. For these rivers, less snow fall and
more rain may alter seasonal flow regimes, resulting in lower stream
flows in late spring through the summer and fall. Changes in flow
regimes may affect salmonids that are adapted to these stream systems.
For the Columbia River, the presence of dams and a highlyengineered
hydrologic system complicate projections of impacts of
climate change on the river’s natural resources and ecosystems.</p>
	<p><b><i>Estuaries</i></b></p>
<p>Estuaries are critical and unique habitats. Estuaries reflect a balance
among competing natural forces. Sustained changes in sea level,
tidal elevations, river flows, or sediment loads would necessarily alter
the shape and productivity of Oregon’s estuaries.</p>
<p><i>Estuarine wetlands</i> Snow melt runoff is a factor in four rivers that are
important to the Oregon coast and coastal fisheries: the Columbia,
Umpqua, Rogue, and Klamath. For these rivers, less snow fall and
more rain may alter seasonal flow regimes, resulting in lower stream
flows in late spring through the summer and fall. Changes in flow
regimes may affect salmonids that are adapted to these stream systems.
For the Columbia River, the presence of dams and a highlyengineered
hydrologic system complicate projections of impacts of
climate change on the river’s natural resources and ecosystems.</p>
	<p><b>Coastal Natural Systems</b><br>
	Many familiar coastal habitats, ecosystems, and natural resources
will be affected by climate change. Low-lying habitats and ecosystems
are especially vulnerable to floods, tides and ocean waves. Temperature
and precipitation changes will affect the distribution and composition
of forests, riparian areas, and other terrestrial habitats. Even
rocky intertidal habitats are vulnerable to increased atmospheric and
ocean temperatures.</p>
	<p><b><i>Rivers and Streams</i></b></p>
<p><i>Coastal rivers:</i> Streams that drain the Coast Range will carry increased

regimes may affect salmonids that are adapted to these stream systems.
For the Columbia River, the presence of dams and a highlyengineered
hydrologic system complicate projections of impacts of
climate change on the river’s natural resources and ecosystems.</p>
	<p><b>Estuaries</b><br>
	Estuaries are critical and unique habitats. Estuaries reflect a balance
among competing natural forces. Sustained changes in sea level,
tidal elevations, river flows, or sediment loads would necessarily alter
the shape and productivity of Oregon’s estuaries.</p>
<p><i>Estuarine wetlands</i> are vulnerable to rising sea level and tidal
elevations, depending on rate of sediment deposition, the nature of
the shoreline, and pace of sea level rise. Freshwater tidal wetlands
may be inundated more frequently by saline waters, triggering
changes in wetland communities. Because most Oregon estuaries are
sharply bounded by steep hillsides or dikes and levees, fringe wetlands
will be unable to migrate landward and will be inundated due to
increased tidal elevation. An adequate supply of sediments to the estuary could enable tidal wetland elevations to keep pace with rising
tidal elevation.</p>
<p><i>Estuarine benthic ecosystems:</i>  Higher air temperatures can
heat mudflats and raise estuarine water temperatures, especially upstream
of ocean influence, thus affecting benthic communities and
productivity. The loss of benthic habitat will directly affect the composition
and productivity of estuarine ecosystems.</p>
<p><i>Ocean spits:</i> Rising sea levels and increased storminess will likely
result in the long-term movement of the sand spits that form the
outer boundary of many Oregon’s estuaries. These forces could result
in breaching of spits, as last occurred to the Tillamook spit in 1952,
and which came close to occurring to the Netarts spit in 2007.</p>
<p><i>Invasive species:</i> Estuaries in the Pacific Northwest have recently
experienced biological invasions of non-native species that
have had significant effects on estuarine communities. Such invasions
may be related to climate factors.</p>
<p><i>Acidification:</i> Oregon’s estuaries are dominated by ocean water
due to high tidal flushing twice daily. As ocean waters become more
acidic, estuaries will be subjected to these same acidic conditions. The
effects of increased acidity on estuarine ecosystems are not yet
known, but scientists are concerned about the potential effects on
clams, crabs, oysters and other shellfish.</p>

<p><b><i>The Pacific Ocean</i></b></p>
<p><i>Ecosystem shifts: </i>Summer winds are critical to upwelling that
drives productivity of marine ecosystems. Recent El Niño events
demonstrated that warmer ocean temperatures and shifting wind patterns
can, from just one season to the next, affect upwelling and the
production of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and forage fish. Seabirds,
marine mammals, salmon and other species were adversely affected
by El Niño conditions and are expected to be affected by long term
shifts in climate conditions.</p>
<p><i>Distribution of species: </i>Long-term changes in ocean conditions
are likely to result in a northward shift in the distribution of marine
species, including sea birds and marine mammals. El Niño conditions
have been cited as a factor in marine mammal mortality, evidence of
warm water fish in waters off Washington, and lack of seabird reproductive
success.</p>
<p><i>Changes in upwelling:</i> Timing of the seasonal upwelling in the
Pacific off Oregon, which provides the nutritional foundation for the
marine food web, is changing. A long-term shift in the timing of up-
welling would have long-lasting effects on Oregon’s commercial and
recreational fisheries.</p>
<p><i>Hypoxia: </i>While it is not clear that climate change is causing the
hypoxic ‘dead zones’ in ocean waters off Oregon, the forces causing
the hypoxia are all linked to, and affected by, climate change.</p>
<p><i>Ocean acidification: </i>Increasing ocean acidification due to its
absorption of CO2 has the potential to reduce the ability of marine
species to form shells, which in turn would have a dramatic effect on
the entire marine food web. Shellfish such as clams, oysters, and
crabs will be particularly sensitive to an increasingly acid environment.</p>
<p><b><i>Coastal shorelands</b></i></p>
<p><i>Ocean shore:</i> The ocean shore will certainly be altered in many
places due to higher sea level, higher waves, more frequent and
stronger storms, and possible shifts in predominant wind directions.
Beach and bluff erosion will result in shoreline retreat. Ocean shores
armored with rip-rap and seawalls will be increasingly at risk over
time.</p>
<p><i>Estuarine shores:</i> The shorelines of estuaries will change over
time as increasing tidal elevations push the “normal” shoreline farther
inland. Habitats and human uses in low-lying areas adjacent to estuaries
are at risk over time even if protected by bulkheads, dikes, or levees.
Habitat restoration projects in coastal shorelands should consider
effects of future climate change.</p>

<p><b><i>Terrestrial and aquatic habitats</b></i></p>
<p><i>Habitat distribution and composition: </i>Terrestrial and aquatic
habitats, which reflect a balance of many factors, will be affected by
changes in climate. As the suitability of habitats declines, the ranges
of species will likewise shift. Salmon populations, especially, are vulnerable
to increased water temperatures and other climate variables
throughout their life histories.</p>
<p><i>Non-native species: </i>Habitat changes in response to shifts in
temperature, salinity, and precipitation will provide opportunities for
invasion by non-native species that are adapted to the new habitat
conditions or that out-compete native species weakened by habitat
change.</p>
<p><b>Coastal Economic Sectors</b><br>
Most of the coast’s natural resource-based economic sectors are
likely to be affected by changing conditions related to climate.</p>
<p><b><i>Ocean Fisheries<p></b><i>
<p><i>Salmonids:</i> Salmon, in particular, are highly vulnerable to
changes in conditions throughout the many parts of coastal and
ocean ecosystems that they occupy during their life. Expected climate-
induced effects on watersheds, rivers, estuaries, and ocean ecosystems
do not bode well for salmon, particularly in stream systems
with already low populations.</p>
<p><i>Harvest effects:<i> Some commercial ocean fish stock, already at
low levels from overharvest, may be at risk over the long term as
ocean conditions change. Changes in ocean ecosystem conditions are
likely to fundamentally alter the historic fisheries of the Oregon
coast.</p>
<p><i>Ocean acidification: <i>Calcium-based plankton, which support
the marine food web, are at risk from even minute changes in ocean
acidity. Changes in plankton production will affect fisheries in ways
that cannot now be predicted. It is not known how larger shellfish,
such as clams, oysters, and crabs will fare in an increasingly acid environment.<p>
<p><b><i>Agriculture</p></b></i>
<p><i>Water supplies:</i> On the south coast, water supplies needed to
harvest cranberry crops may be problematic. Overall, surface water
supplies from rainfall are expected to increase due to winter rains.
<p><i>Dikes, levees, and tidegates:<i> Dikes, levees, and other structures
that create and protect agricultural lands around Coos Bay, Young’s
River, Tillamook Bay, and other estuaries and tidally-influenced rivers
will be subject to higher tidal elevations and riverine flooding as sea
level rises. The condition of many of these structures is not known.</p>

<p><b><i>Forestry</p></b></i>
<p><i>Forest mix:</i> The mix of tree species in Oregon’s Coast Range
Mountains and coastal lowlands is likely to change in response to
changes in temperature and precipitation regimes. Broadleaf species
are projected to increase in conifer forests. Forest managers may
need to adjust the composition of species to be planted after harvest.
Insects and disease that respond to various climate conditions will
affect forest composition.</p>
<p><i>Forest growth:</i> Warmer temperatures, increased precipitation in
winter, and higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere will likely stimulate
forest growth.</p>
<p><i>Forest resilience:</i> Forests in the Coast Range, unlike forests
elsewhere in the U.S., are likely to be relatively resilient to the increased
winter precipitation and longer, drier summers that are projected.</p>
<p><i>Fires: </i>Despite hotter, drier, and longer summers and an increase
in woody growth and insect outbreaks, the risk of forest fires in the
Coast Range is projected to remain relatively stable because of increased
wet conditions during winter.</p>

<p><b>Travel and hospitality</b><br>
The Oregon coast has long been an attractive destination for
tourists and for those who enjoy its many outdoor recreational opportunities
and resources. Businesses in these sectors may benefit
from the effects of climate change on the Oregon coast.</p>
<p><i>Recreation:</i> Longer, drier summers may benefit Oregon’s coastal
recreation industries by extending the recreation season and expanding
options. However, parks and recreational facilities along the
ocean shore and around estuaries are likely to be affected from increased
winter storms, ocean flooding, and over time, sea level rise.</p>
<p><i>Tourism: </i>The Oregon coast may realize expanded tourist visitation
because of a relatively mild and dry summer climate and extended
travel season. Compared to other parts of the country, the
Oregon coast may be seen as very comfortable, whether in summer
or in winter, and therefore very desirable.</p>

<p><b>Growth and development</b><br>
Climate conditions, even though changed from historic patterns,
may be relatively attractive compared to other parts of the country
and therefore may attract “climate-refugees” seeking more optimum
climate conditions. Coastal communities could thus experience increased
in-migration, particularly retired persons, which would increase
demand for residential and commercial development and
demands on public facilities.	<h2 class="headerColor">"</h2></p>
	<!-- the section below was the content of this page before it was changed to the OCMP content -->
	<!-- <p>You should be concerned that what you <b>value</b> about the Oregon coast is <b>vulnerable</b> to the <b>impacts of climate change and variability.</b></p>
				
	<p><i><b>How do I know what to value?</b></i> It is a good question that only you can answer. Value is defined as worth, desirability, or utility based on individual preferences. The total value of any resource is the sum of the values of the different individuals involved in the use of the resource (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007). Start by thinking about things you know that you value about the Oregon coast. What you value could be based on a personal experience traveling to the coast, or it could be based on what you know about the economic livelihood of your entire community. Also, listen to what other people are saying.</p>
				
	<p><i><b>How do I know whether what I value will could be impacted by regional climate change and variability?</b></i>
	It is also a good question, but probably not something you can answer yourself without good scientific information.
	Look at the section below entitled "Nine Ways that Climate Change and Variability Could Impact What You Value." You might discover that the things you value 
    most are not likely to impacted by climate change and variability. 
	What you value more right now about the Oregon coast might change depending on what you learn about potential future impacts.</p>
				
	<p><i><b>How do I know whether what I value is vulnerable?</b></i> Ask yourself whether you are concerned about regional climate change and variability on the Oregon coast because it impacts what you value most, because it impacts what you think is most vulnerable, or a little of both. Then ask yourself where the vulnerability comes from? Are you concerned because it seems what you value is highly exposed to climate change and variability? Are you concerned because it seems what you value is highly sensitive to climate change and variability? Or are you concerned because you do not think that your public agency decision makers, the scientific experts, or others are doing enough to help you deal with the impacts of climate change and variability on what you value?</p>
				
	<p><i><b>By the way, am I supposed to know the difference between climate change and climate variability?</b></i>
	It probably wouldn't hurt. See below.</p>
	
	<h2 class="headerColor">Climate Change vs. Climate Variability</h2>
				
	<p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate <b>change</b> refers to a <b>statistically significant variation</b> in
	either the mean state of the climate or in its variability,
	persisting for an extended period (typically decades or longer).
	Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or
	external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in
	the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that
	the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
	Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines “climate change”
	as: “a change of climate which is attributed directly or
	indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the
	global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate
	variability observed over comparable time periods.” The
	UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between “climate change”
	attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric
	composition, and “climate variability” attributable to natural
	causes.</p>
				
	<p>Climate <b>variability</b> refers to <b>variations</b> in the mean state and other
	statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes,
	etc.) of the climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond
	that of individual weather events. Variability may be due to
	natural internal processes within the climate system (internal
	variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic
	external forcing (external variability).</p>
				
	<h2 class="headerColor">Ways Climate Change and Variability Might Impact Values</h2>
	<p>To help you in your thinking about impacts, use this quick guide to <b>9</b> things that are probably going to be different about 
	your regional climate in the future and what to expect as a result (general list based on Australian Greenhouse Office 2006). 
	What indicators would you want public agencies to use in order to measure those impacts?</p>

	<p>Look at the expected impacts of higher mean temperatures. Will something you value about the Oregon coast be impacted? 
	If so, think of the best indicator to measure the impact specifically on what you value. Consider the other eight impacts below.</p>
