	<p>The Oregon Coastal Management Program, part of Oregon's Department of Land Conservation and Development released a document in January 2009 entitled 
	<i>CLIMATE READY COMMUNITIES: A Strategy for Adapting to Impacts of Climate Change on the Oregon Coast</i>. This document includes the discussion of 
	"The Likely Effects of Climate Change on the Oregon Coast," which is excerpted below.  Read the full document on the OCMP website <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/ENERGY/GBLWRM/docs/climate_ready_communities.pdf"title="CLIMATE READY COMMUNITIES">here</a>.</p>

	<b>Climate and the Oregon Coast</b></p>
	<p>The likely effects of climate change on the Oregon
coast may come as no surprise to Oregonians who are familiar
with winter storms and the variability of the climate
and ocean conditions on the Oregon coast. The El Niño
climate events of 1982-83 and 1997-98 gave Oregonians a
taste of higher sea level, stronger storms, warmer ocean
temperatures, and altered marine ecosystem.</p>
	<p>Oregon’s coastal communities have begun to experience
the effects of climate change in the form of higher wave
heights, more powerful winter storms, and major ocean
shoreline erosion. Other phenomena are expected due to
the Earth’s changing climate such as rising sea level and
tidal height, hypoxic nearshore ocean waters, seasonal temperature
changes, more acidic ocean waters, and changes in
forest cover.</p>
	<p>It is important that coastal communities understand the
potential effects of climate change in order to take action to
avoid risks, reduce damage and make choices that will
maximize community resilience. This paper outlines some
of the principal ways that the Oregon coast is likely to be
affected.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Key Physical Changes in Oregon’s
Coastal Climate and Weather</b></p>
	<p>Changes in Earth’s climate, driven by atmospheric
warming caused by greenhouse gases, will affect the climate
and weather of the Oregon coast in a variety of ways, some
familiar, others dramatically new. Exactly how these
changes will affect any particular community or region of
the coast cannot now be accurately predicted. However,
scientific evidence strongly suggests that coastal climate and
weather are likely to change in four principal ways.</p>
	<p><i>Temperature</i><br>
	The current best estimate for future warming is about 0.5° F per
decade, at least in the next few decades. The Pacific Northwest is projected
to have greater warming during summer than in the winter.
The mean temperature may increase significantly beyond current
ranges over the course of the next century.</p>
	<p><i>Storms</i><br>
	Data show that both the frequency and intensity of storms have
increased in recent years, and individual storms are producing higher
waves and storm surges. Projected changes suggest that future winter
storms may be similar to recent strong El Niño-influenced storms
that accelerated coastal erosion. More frequent, longer and more intense
storms will cause greater damage.</p>
	<p><i>Sea level</i><br>
	Sea level is expected to rise significantly by 2100 but how much
cannot now be predicted for any given location. Average sea level
rose worldwide about 6.7 inches in the 20th century. A recent report
concluded that sea level could rise on the Washington coast by 22
inches by 2050 and by 50 inches by 2100. The most current projections
do not include the effects of rapid ice melt being experienced in
Greenland or Antarctica. Sea level rise will generate increased tidal
heights in estuaries and coastal rivers that are affected by tides.</p>
	<p><i>Precipitation</i><br>
	Precipitation in the Pacific Northwest is expected to increase but
to remain within historical ranges for rainfall. Winter precipitation is
projected to increase, while summers will be longer and even drier
than at present. For the Coast Range and lower elevations, precipitation will be mostly rain, as at present. Some research anticipates an
increase in intense precipitation events.</p>
	<b>Likely Effects on Oregon’s Coastal
Communities</b></p>
	<p>Climate shapes communities in many ways; some obvious,
others subtle. The economy and culture of coastal
communities, for instance, are tightly linked to climate. Historic
precipitation patterns and generally mild temperature
support the timber, agricultural, and recreational economic
sectors. The effects of climate changes can be generally described,
even though their magnitude, timing, and location
cannot be known for certain. Anticipating both gradual
change and episodic events is essential to enable communities
to become resilient to effects from climate change.</p>
	<p><b>Community Infrastructure</b><br>
	Climate conditions are generally factored into the design of
community infrastructure. As climate conditions change, some infrastructure
systems may be less effective or may fail altogether, which
could alter the function, value, or viability of improvements these
systems protect or serve.</p>
	<p><b><i>Transportation and navigation</i></b></p>
<p><i>Coastal roads, highways, and rail lines</i> are at risk from the effects
of increased winter precipitation, increased coastal erosion, and
flooding. Over the long term, roads, highways, and railroads will be
affected by sea level rise and increased tidal elevations along the
ocean shore, estuaries, and coastal rivers.</p>
<p><i>Airport runways</i> such as those in North Bend and Astoria are
located on filled estuarine wetlands and may be at risk of inundation
from storm surge and high tides and, over time by sea level and increased
tidal heights.</p>
<p><i>Port facilities, jetties and groins</i> will be subject to damage
from larger storm waves. Watershed flooding may increase sediment
loads into estuaries and thus increase the need for dredging of navigational
channels. Increased tidal height will affect docks and bulkheads.</p>
 
	<p><b><i>Shore Protection and Flood Control Structures</i></b></p>
<p><i>Dikes and levees:</i> Extensive areas in Oregon’s estuaries are protected
from tidal inundation by dikes and levees. Rising sea level and
the increased likelihood of inundation from higher storm surge and
tidal heights, especially in times of river flooding, may threaten the
integrity of dikes and levees. Infrastructure and development on lands
protected by dikes are at risk of damage and inundation as dikes fail.</p>
<p><i>Shore protection improvements:</i> Some portions of Oregon’s
ocean shorelines have been armored against erosion from ocean
waves, primarily in front of properties developed before 1977. As
shorelines erode landward in response to higher sea level and storms,
armored properties are at risk of becoming peninsulas, then islands,
and then overtopped. An increase in significant wave heights is likely
to damage or cause failure of some hardened shorelines, potentially
resulting in damage to nearby unprotected property and infrastructure.</p>
 
	<p><b><i>Municipal Services</i></b></p>
<p><i>Stormwater systems:</i> The capacity of local stormwater management
systems may be exceeded as the magnitude or frequency of
rainfall events increases, especially as tidal elevations rise leading to
localized flooding, accelerated deterioration, and possible system failure.
Systems at or near capacity today may be unable to handle future
storm loads, which could have a significant effect on location of future
development.</p>
<p><i>Water supply and wastewater treatment:</i> Rainfall in winter is
projected to increase. However, storing water across longer, drier
summers may be a problem for some coastal communities where
storage systems are already at or over capacity during summer. Reduced
precipitation in summer months, especially in conjunction with
warmer winter temperatures, may reduce the water available for municipal
supply systems. In addition, wastewater treatment facilities are
usually located at the lowest elevation in a watershed, which places
those facilities at risk from rising sea level and tidal elevation.</p>
<p><i>Recreational facilities:</i> Increased erosion along Oregon’s ocean
shore from rising sea levels and coastal storms may seriously alter
beaches, and in some cases, the infrastructure necessary for safe access
to and from beaches and coastal parks. Coastal forest trails and
campgrounds may experience frequent damage from high winds and
flooding.</p>

	<!-- <p>You should be concerned that what you <b>value</b> about the Oregon coast is <b>vulnerable</b> to the <b>impacts of climate change and variability.</b></p>
				
	<p><i><b>How do I know what to value?</b></i> It is a good question that only you can answer. Value is defined as worth, desirability, or utility based on individual preferences. The total value of any resource is the sum of the values of the different individuals involved in the use of the resource (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007). Start by thinking about things you know that you value about the Oregon coast. What you value could be based on a personal experience traveling to the coast, or it could be based on what you know about the economic livelihood of your entire community. Also, listen to what other people are saying.</p>
				
	<p><i><b>How do I know whether what I value will could be impacted by regional climate change and variability?</b></i>
	It is also a good question, but probably not something you can answer yourself without good scientific information.
	Look at the section below entitled "Nine Ways that Climate Change and Variability Could Impact What You Value." You might discover that the things you value 
    most are not likely to impacted by climate change and variability. 
	What you value more right now about the Oregon coast might change depending on what you learn about potential future impacts.</p>
				
	<p><i><b>How do I know whether what I value is vulnerable?</b></i> Ask yourself whether you are concerned about regional climate change and variability on the Oregon coast because it impacts what you value most, because it impacts what you think is most vulnerable, or a little of both. Then ask yourself where the vulnerability comes from? Are you concerned because it seems what you value is highly exposed to climate change and variability? Are you concerned because it seems what you value is highly sensitive to climate change and variability? Or are you concerned because you do not think that your public agency decision makers, the scientific experts, or others are doing enough to help you deal with the impacts of climate change and variability on what you value?</p>
				
	<p><i><b>By the way, am I supposed to know the difference between climate change and climate variability?</b></i>
	It probably wouldn't hurt. See below.</p>
	
	<h2 class="headerColor">Climate Change vs. Climate Variability</h2>
				
	<p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate <b>change</b> refers to a <b>statistically significant variation</b> in
	either the mean state of the climate or in its variability,
	persisting for an extended period (typically decades or longer).
	Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or
	external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in
	the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that
	the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
	Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines “climate change”
	as: “a change of climate which is attributed directly or
	indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the
	global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate
	variability observed over comparable time periods.” The
	UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between “climate change”
	attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric
	composition, and “climate variability” attributable to natural
	causes.</p>
				
	<p>Climate <b>variability</b> refers to <b>variations</b> in the mean state and other
	statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes,
	etc.) of the climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond
	that of individual weather events. Variability may be due to
	natural internal processes within the climate system (internal
	variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic
	external forcing (external variability).</p>
				
	<h2 class="headerColor">Ways Climate Change and Variability Might Impact Values</h2>
	<p>To help you in your thinking about impacts, use this quick guide to <b>9</b> things that are probably going to be different about 
	your regional climate in the future and what to expect as a result (general list based on Australian Greenhouse Office 2006). 
	What indicators would you want public agencies to use in order to measure those impacts?</p>

	<p>Look at the expected impacts of higher mean temperatures. Will something you value about the Oregon coast be impacted? 
	If so, think of the best indicator to measure the impact specifically on what you value. Consider the other eight impacts below.</p>
