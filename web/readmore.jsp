<h3>Overview</h3>

<div class="cssbox_body">
<p>There are five steps in the <i>Let's Improve Transportation</i> decision
process. When this website is complete, participants will be able to
take part in all 5 steps. Right now, only Step 1: Discuss Concerns is
ready for use.</p>

<div id="cont-main">
  <h3><strong><a name="step1">Step 1: Discuss Concerns</a></strong></h3>
  <p>Before we can determine how to best  improve the transportation system, we need to know what the problems are. There  are two parts of this step:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1a: Brainstorm
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Participants&nbsp; brainstorm and &ldquo;tag&rdquo; concerns about the  transportation system.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1b: Review Summaries
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The  moderator identifies themes among these concerns and writes a preliminary  summary synthesis of each theme.</li>
        <li> Participants  review and discuss the synthesis, and suggest revisions.</li>
        <li>The moderator revises themes to reflect participant suggestions, as appropriate. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="step2">Step 2: Review Criteria</a></h3>
  <p>Criteria are used to evaluate which  proposed transportation projects are best suited to address problems  with our  current transportation system. Researchers identified a list of  criteria before this process began, so that data relevant to these  criteria could be gathered in advance of the decision process.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2a: Review Criteria
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li> Participants review and discuss criteria in order to evaluate  how adequately they reflect each concern theme. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2b: Weigh Criteria
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
         
        Participants individually choose their favorite  criteria and weigh the relative importance of these criteria for project evaluation. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="step3">Step 3: Create Packages</a></h3>
  <p>In this step participants review proposed road and transit projects for  improving the regional transportation system, and then create their own  personal transportation improvement &quot;package&quot;. A &quot;transportation  package&quot; is simply a set of transportation projects  and sources of money to pay for those projects. Decision makers often  create packages as options to simplify regional transportation  improvement financing decisions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 3a: Review Projects</strong><br /> 
      Prior to this decision process, a panel of transportation specialists have evaluated each of the proposed projects and assigned them with scores for each criterion.
        <ul>
          <li>Participants review a map of proposed road and transit projects.</li>
          <li>Participants review information about projects of interest as well as project scores.</li>
          <li>Participants discuss the appropriateness of project scores and the  relative importance of different projects and project alternatives.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 3b: Select Funding Options</strong><br />Here you can read about available funding sources and express their preferences for how funds should be raised to fund a transportation improvment project.
      <ul>
        <li>Participants review descriptions of funding sources</li>
        <li>Participants select prefered funding options and see how much money these  options would raise. The participant can also see how much money these  options would cost him/her per year.</li>
        <li>Participant can select a maximum amount per year he/she is willing to spend in additional taxes.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 3c: Create Personal Transportation Package</strong><br />Based on the your prefered criteria weights and prefered funding options, a suggested transportation improvment package is displayed. Here you can revise this suggested package to create your own personal transportation package.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="step4">Step 4: Evaluate Packages</a></h3>
  <p>In order to simplify the decision process, we need to narrow down the number of different packages considered. Therefore, based on participant responses in Step 3, five new packages are automatically constructed. These packages will represent the diversity of participant preferences in terms of both project selection as well as funding source selection. In this step participants evaluate the five new packages and determine which one(s) to collectively endorse.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>4a: Review Packages
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Participants can read a brief overview of the  processes by which the 5 candidate packages were created.</li>
        <li>Participants review information about each individual package.</li>
        <li>Participants discuss the relative benefits and drawbacks of individual packages.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>4b: Compare Packages
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Participants use a variety of different tools for comparing the  benefits and drawbacks of the five packages, such as cost, spatial  equity, and overall scores for each of the criteria.</li>
        <li>Participants can adjust their criteria weights to see how each package  measures up based on their personal weighting choices. They can also  compare the ranking of packages based on their own criteria weights to  the aggregate criteria weights of all participants.</li>
        <li>Participants discuss the potential benefits and  drawbacks of the different packages.  </li>
        <li>
         
        Participants discuss whether or not they wish to  collectively endorse the top-ranked package.</li>
        <li>The moderator periodically polls participants to measure&nbsp; the degree  to which a consensus is emerging regarding which package to  collectively endorse.</li>
        <li>At a designated time, all participants are asked to vote to endorse the package currently enjoying the majority of support.</li>
        <li>Dissenting voters discuss whether or not they  wish to include a minority endorsement in the group report. If yes, then they  vote on which package to endorse.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="step5">Step 5: Prepare Group Report</a></h3>
  <p>The final step is to compose a report about the results of this  decision process which will be delivered to transportation decision makers. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The moderator creates a first draft and notifies participants when it is ready.</li>
    <li>
     
    Participants  review and discuss this draft report and submit their comments and suggested  revisions.</li>
    <li>
     
    The  moderator makes revisions and includes participant comments when appropriate.</li>
    <li>
     
    Participants  review the final report.</li>
    <li>All  participants vote on whether to approve or disapprove the report. If majority  approve the report is forwarded on to decision makers. (Results of this final  vote will be included in the report sent on to decision makers.)</li>
  </ul>
