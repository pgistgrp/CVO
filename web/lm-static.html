		<p>
			Let's Improve Transportation (LIT) is an experiment in participatory democracy. A research team based at the 
			University of Washington has developed an innovative new website where you can:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>learn about proposed improvements to the central Puget Sound regional transportation system,</li>
			<li>consider the potential impacts of these changes on our communities, and</li>
			<li>work collaboratively with other residents to determine which changes the region should support.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			This October, residents of King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties are invited to participate in the LIT Challenge, 
			a 4-week long online experiment in which 300 or more individuals will participate via the Internet at their own 
			convenience. The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate a new and potentially more meaningful way to involve 
			citizens in the process of regional transportation decision making.
		</p>

		<p>
			Participants in the LIT Challenge are asked to imagine they are a member of a large citizen advisory committee 
			charged with providing policy makers with their recommendations regarding the make-up of a regional transportation 
			ballot measure. The (hypothetical) measure will ask voters in the region if they wish to raise taxes to pay for a 
			package of road and transit improvement projects. The task of LIT Challenge participants is to determine which 
			proposed transportation improvement projects to build and which funding mechanisms (such as taxes or bridge tolls) 
			should be used to pay for these improvements. The challenging part is to get as many participants as possible to 
			collectively recommend a single "package" of projects and funding options. Fortunately, the LIT website was 
			designed to support exactly this kind of challenge. The website, as well as a small team of online moderators, 
			will facilitate a process in which participants:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>brainstorm concerns,</li>
			<li>assess different goals for transportation improvement,</li>
			<li>create personal "packages" of transportation projects and funding,</li>
			<li>discuss and evaluate 5 representative packages in order to determine which ones can gain the greatest degree of 
				participant support,</li>
			<li>and compose a report to communicate the final recommendations to the public and policy makers.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			While this may sound complicated, the website is designed to lead any interested citizen through the process. No prior 
			experience with transportation issues is necessary. It is estimated that full participation in the LIT Challenge will 
			take as little as 8-10 hours over the four week period. Qualified participants who complete the LIT Challenge will 
			receive compensation for their efforts.
		</p>
		
		<h4>How is LIT related to the (real world) "Roads and Transit" ballot measure in November 2007?</h4>
 
		<p>
			In the real world, regional policy makers have already created a single "Roads and Transit" package and will be asking voters 
			in King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties whether or not it should become law. The "Roads and Transit‚Äù package is the result 
			of years of negotiations between county elected officials as well as pressure from businesses, transportation advocacy 
			organizations, and concerned members of the public. Transportation funding ballot measures such as this one have become increasingly 
			common in metropolitan regions across the U.S.
		</p>

		<p>
			LIT is an attempt to design a more meaningful way to involve members of the public in regional transportation decision making 
			before a single package is placed on the ballot. Therefore the outcome of the LIT Challenge will no effect on the make-up of the 
			"Roads and Transit" package. However participants will have the opportunity to carefully examine the "Roads and Transit" package and 
			compare it to alternative packages created based on participant input. Researchers also hope that the LIT Challenge will serve as a 
			model for how to involve the public in future regional transportation decisions.
