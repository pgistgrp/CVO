        <purpose>In order to determine what needs to be improved about our transportation system, we first need to know what the problems are. Therefore, the first task is brainstorming concerns.</purpose>
        <instruction>For this task, we are asking you to add concerns to your profile. These concerns will be visible to other participants, and will be used in later sessions to determine how to turn our concerns into suggestions for decision makers. Below, you’ll find a box in which to type your concern. You will be asked to ‘tag’ your concerns, so that others may find your concern more easily. The sidebar to the right of your concerns is your way of seeing what others are writing about. You may navigate by either tags or concerns.</instruction>
