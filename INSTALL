-- PGIST system is based on Java 1.5+, Tomcat 6.0.14+, PostGreSQL 8.2+. So the first thing is to download and install those softwares.

-- PGIST source codes are managed by CVS server, so make sure one kind of cvs client can work on your machine.

-- PGIST source codes will be compiled/deployed by Apache Ant, so make sure the command ant can work on your machine.

-- PGIST CVS server is protected by SSH, so make sure you can create a ssh tunnel from your machine to PGIST server.


1. Create ssh tunnel from your machine to PGIST server.
   Basically use such command as:
      $ /usr/bin/ssh -2 -N -f -L 6666:localhost:2401 username@128.95.212.210
   Which will map the 2401 port of PGIST server to 6666 port on your machine.
   
2. Check out source codes from the CVS server.
   Basically use such command as:
      $ /usr/bin/cvs -d:pserver:username@localhost:6666/opt/cvsroot/repository2 login
      $ /usr/bin/cvs -d:pserver:username@localhost:6666/opt/cvsroot/repository2 co CVO
   Which will create a directory CVO on your machine.
   
3. Under CVO, Copy build-sample.properties to build.properties, and setup your correct Tomcat position.

4. Under CVO, create your database with:
      $ ant createdb
   Which will create the whole database schema and initialize it with data from directory initdata.
   
5. Under CVO, deploy PGIST system with:
      $ ant deploy
   Which will copy the runtime files to your Tomcat.
   
6. Open a browser, and visit:
   http://localhost:8080
   

Enjoy it!
